# Predicting the Probability of Catastrophe for Flight Impacts with Animals

Birds have always been an interest of mine. I wanted to make a bird related machine learning model, and predicting bird species by bird call or image is too obvious. Here, I predict the probability of catastrophe for flight impacts with animals, almost all of which are birds. More specifically, I predict the chance of aircraft damage, injury, and death. The models take aircraft type, animal species, animal quantity, impact location, elevation, and speed of impact into account.

Over 650,000 animals were harmed in the making of these models.
